Add high score thing!
change list foreach?
remove blank end patterns
recursive search for best track representation?

only allow adjacent channels to to mixed
	startchan, endchan - instead of *channels

change duplicate track merge till after dots are generated?
	- buried.xm merges tracks 1-4 since they have the same ins, then
	  finds that it matches a drum track since it has a beat on each
	  row, but it may be (or maybe not... :) silly to match these up
change Press to be based on ticks, not on row
check and fix physics stuff - implement fixed point and float point physics
	multiply timer stuff in timer.c - eg 1/2*t*t for acceleration
	rather than multiply it over and over for each object in a frame
see if mikmod supports channel masking or something similar
check if GL_DITHER should be disabled

cannona.it stops playing after row 24

use joykey.up or something, set it to 1 when SDLKEYUP/JOYBUTTONUP and 0 on SDLKEYDOWN/JOYBUTTONDOWN - refire event after a delay (rather than use the KeyRepeating thing, since this will work for joysticks too)

music plays while switching song

add in thing to not play the first note of a track if we're not on that track
	(it starts not muted and so plays a little, but if we're not on the
	track there is no chance we will hit it - make sense?)
takes long to quit - log?

fix event system - use user events? do anything that doesn't suck?
draw transparent objects after opaque ones - use readonly depth buf
	- disable blending during opaque objects for speed??

Check volume for magicrai.s3m - are all those dots really there?

clean up glinit
difficulty - spacing of dots, timing of when you press button
	- also include presets "easy" "medium" "hard" ?

add in cfg for mods - allow naming of tracks?

speed limit signs when the speed changes (but not when it changes every other row!)

fix mod loading scheme - it blowz! - handle blank tracks too

different duders:
	fireball duder, must hit extra fireball note or explode (for a little bit)
	darkness duder - make screen dark
	invisible duder - make notes shift in/out of visibility
	silencer - turns off the music
	other duders

more video options - eg texture enable/disable, lightning, etc etc
sort transparent objects to render them properly (or cheat) (or leave as is)
Add 3d font?
compress sounds with zlib?
check mem usage?
midi support?
writing a gmae :)
