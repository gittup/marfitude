multiple buttons for single action
mk GRAPH=1 install fails to generate graph and leaves dep.dot around
fix cfg.c - don't use header.option thing
allow user to enter initials
keep track of multiple high scores (eg. top 5)

change list foreach?
remove blank end patterns
recursive search for best track representation?

only allow adjacent channels to to mixed
	startchan, endchan - instead of *channels

check and fix physics stuff
	multiply timer stuff in timer.c - eg 1/2*t*t for acceleration
	rather than multiply it over and over for each object in a frame

cannona.it stops playing after row 24

use joykey.up or something, set it to 1 when SDLKEYUP/JOYBUTTONUP and 0 on SDLKEYDOWN/JOYBUTTONDOWN - refire event after a delay (rather than use the KeyRepeating thing, since this will work for joysticks too)

play music while switching song?

add in thing to not play the first note of a track if we're not on that track
	(it starts not muted and so plays a little, but if we're not on the
	track there is no chance we will hit it - make sense?)

fix event system - use user events? do anything that doesn't suck?
draw transparent objects after opaque ones - use readonly depth buf
	- disable blending during opaque objects for speed??

clean up glinit
difficulty - spacing of dots, timing of when you press button
	- also include presets "easy" "medium" "hard" ?

add in cfg for mods - allow naming of tracks?

speed limit signs when the speed changes ?

more video options - eg texture enable/disable, lightning, etc etc
sort transparent objects to render them properly (or cheat) (or leave as is)
Add 3d font?
compress sounds with zlib?
check mem usage?
midi support?
writing a gmae :)
