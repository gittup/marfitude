<p>This is the page for Marfitude, a totally awesome cool game that you want to play. It's based off a game called Amplitude for the Playstation 2, which is totally awesomer and cooler, so you should play that first. But this game is cool too because it uses <a href="http://www.modarchive.com/">MOD</a> files, which make anything rockin'.</p>
<h2>Huge News!! (2005/12/10)</h2>
<p>New release of Marfitude! Here's some cool new features:<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Quadrotron-o-matrix</b>: You and three friends can play a MOD at the same time! It's like you're in a rock band, but you play MODs. It's a MOD band. Chicks dig MOD bands.</li>
  <li><b>Difficulty Selection</b>: Select how much you want to rock out! (Before you were always on maximum rock-out, so take pride in that.)</li>
  <li><b>More Buttons</b>: YES! Everyone loves more buttons! Now you can use the Shifter to do lots of weird and crazy stuff. And the Selector is cool too, I guess.</li>
  <li><b>Outer Space</b>: Holy crap! It's like Marfitude, but in outer space! Actually I just looked at the complete blackness of the original game (due to lack of graphics), and I says to myself, I says: "Hey, that looks like outer space!" So then I put some white dots in there for stars and now I call it the space level. But let's be honest, it still sucks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Play</h3>

<h4>Windows</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Download!</li>
  <li>Unzip on your desktop for easy access!</li>
  <li>Double click marfitude!</li>
  <li>Scream for joy!</li>
</ol>

<h4>Mac OSX</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Download!</li>
  <li>Double click Marfitude.dmg!</li>
  <li>Drag the Marfitude icon to the Desktop for easy access!</li>
  <li>Double click Marfitude!</li>
  <li>Dance and sing!</li>
</ol>

<h4>Compiling from Source</h4>
<p>In theory, the source compiles for Linux, FreeBSD, Darwin, and cross compiles to Windows with MinGW - in theory. There's no configure script, just run 'tup' from the top level and watch it break. You also need to have SDL and SDL-image installed before it will work. Get them from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">http://www.libsdl.org</a>, which is an awesome site. The game uses SDL-mixer too, but that is included with the download since it was edited to play more MODs.</p>
<p>Eg:</p>
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/gittup/marfitude
$ tup
$ cd bin
$ ./marfitude
$ echo 'Wow, that was the greatest game ever!'
</pre>

<h4>What the Buttons Is</h4>
<p>Notice how there are no longer completely counter-intuitive and uncomfortable default button settings. You'll be asked to set them when you start for the first time. You can change them later in the Configure menu. Also notice how Marfitude lets you express yourself by choosing your own button style of play. This is just one reason why Marfitude rocks.</p>

But they're there.</td>

<h3>What the F-bomb is Marfitude?</h3>
<p>It's a beat matching game - you hit buttons to play along with music. If you like music but playing an instrument is hard for you, you'll love this game because there's only like three buttons. Also you get points.</p>

<h3>The sound works, but there's no music. I thought you said this game was about music?</h3>
<p>You have to shoot the grey dots with your lasers to make music, just like in real life. You have three lasers, and you shoot the dot when the dot goes over your blue target thing. Set up your laser buttons in the configuration menu. Laser 1 is on the left, Laser 3 is on the right. Also, Laser 2 is in the middle. Also also, you can use the repeat button and it will shoot the last laser geshotten (that's German for "is shooted"). So if you press like "1, repeat, 2" it's the same as "1, 1, 2". You can also use left and right to move between the tracks. You should only move to the next track when the one you're on explodes in a mad crazy explosion of things. That's when you get points. You can also leave the track if you don't like it or if it's tough. The up and down buttons only work in the menu.</p>

<h3>Why is there only one song to play?</h3>
<p>To download faster. Also, I don't know if I would have to ask each MOD artist if I'm allowed to include it. I asked the one dude who made the song that's in there, but haven't heard back from him. If I hear otherwise I'll remove it :). Anyways, here's a list of cool songs at <a href="http://www.modarchive.com/">http://www.modarchive.com</a> that I like to play and are cool. Just download them, unzip them, and put them in the <b>music</b> directory. (Mac users: Ctrl-click Marfitude, then open up Contents -&gt; MacOS -&gt; music). Let me know if you find any other cool songs, but that shouldn't be hard since all MODs are cool.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>childrnx.it - Venice Mask by aRTy</b> (This is how remixes are supposed to be - reminiscent of the original song, and in MOD format!)</li>
<li><b>CHIM-KLF.MOD - Chime 94</b> (For you Orbital fans, which should be everyone)</li>
<li><b>nb-ret2d - Return 2the dream:Nightbeat</b> (Nightbeat totally knows what MODs are all about)</li>
<li><b>buried.xm - BURIED IN CONCRETE</b> (A great happy tune "Take a deep breath, and relax")</li>
<li><b>ad-goodt.xm -</b> (Fun song with guitars, and guitars are awesome)</li>
<li><b>infinity.s3m - 'infinity' - necros/khyron</b> (Zis iz eggzellent MOD!)</li>
<li><b>network.s3m - Network -</b> (See if you can break 10000!)</li>
<li><b>mekx-rmb.s3m - Eternal Respect - Mad Max</b> (One of the greatest MODs of all time, and fun to play)</li>
<li><b>memories_1.it - Memories</b> (Totally lame, and totally cool)</li>
<li><b>scratch.s3m -</b> (For people who like songs that go "doom doom chi adoogadoom chi")</li>
<li><b>azo_cotb.it - Carol of the Bells/Remix</b> (For some Christmas fun)</li>
<li><b>race.mod - Race of the giants</b> (Für das Deutschen Raver genügens)
<li><b>onelastwish.xm - One last wish</b> (Songs like this make me think the game should be called <i>KickAssitude</i>)
</ul>

<h3>How do I make the screen bigger?</h3>
<p>Did you look in the Options menu? Of course not. If you did, you wouldn't Frequently Ask this Question! So if you go there now, you can change the screen size. The screen will actually resize when you leave the Options menu. You can even make it huge by using <b>Marfitude's Too-Cool FullScreen Ambiview Technology&reg;</b>! You saw it here first, folks. Everyone else is just a lame copycat. Not a lame copycat in the "Hey, that's a totally unoriginal game concept" way, but in the "Yo jerkface, you copied <b>Marfitude's Too-Cool FullScreen Ambiview Technology&reg;</b>! You're lame!" way. You know what I'm sayin'.</p>

<h3>Why are the graphics so crappy?</h3>
<p>I think you need to get your eyes checked, mister. The graphics are awesome, just like MODs. Actually, my computer is just old and can't handle much more than what you see. Plus, I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to graphics. It's all about the music anyway, man.</p>

<h3>Why is the sound so crappy?</h3>
<p>I assume you mean that the sound is popping or crackling, and not that the quality of MODs suck, since that would be impossible. Try changing the "Sound buffer [bytes]" thing in the Options menu to something higher.</p>

<h3>How do I play multiplayer?</h3>
<p>Multiplayer? What the crapnutz is that? Oh, you mean Marfitude's <b>Quadrotron-o-matrix</b>. Yes of course. Well assuming you set up the buttons for all the players in the Configuration menu, other players can join in at any time by pressing their Menu button. With more than one person in the game, you can leave by pressing Menu and then selecting Leave. I'm not quite sure how I made that so super-cool, but I did.</p>

<h3>Your game is interesting to me, and I would like to know its history</h3>
<p>Marfitude was made because I had no job and decided I would make a video game, because video games are awesome. I wasn't gonna name it Marfitude - it was originally just called 'gmae', and it was gonna be an RPG. But then I ended up with this game instead (it's not an RPG). Then my friend G-Face Capone - The Heart Stopper came to play volleyball on my birthday and then he played the game and called it Marfitude after me, Marf, and the game's likeness, Amplitude.</p>

<h3>If it was originally 'gmae' and now it's 'Marfitude', why does the title screen say 'Pogen'?</h3>
<p>I think it looks funny</p>

<h3>Marf, your game seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why is it so popular?</h3>
<p>It's not because my game is awesome (though it is awesome), it's because all these things are awesome:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.modarchive.com/">MODs</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a></li>
  <li>Amplitude</li>
  <li>The Simpsons</li>
  <li>Everyone listed in the PROPS file</li>
  <li>Chocolate Milk</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can I get my name in the PROPS file?</h3>
<p>Simple - donate! Well, not to me, per se, since on the planet Marfalomew moneyz has no meaning. But, here on Earth (I'm told), these fine places could use your help:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.diabetes.org/">American Diabetes Association</a>: Help Kimbobomabo out!</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.hmc.psu.edu/fourdiamonds/">Four Diamonds Fund</a>: Kids + Cancer = Teh SUx0rZ!!</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.redcross.org/">Red Cross</a>: Save the universe!</li>
  <li>Any other cool place you like!</li>
</ul>
<p>Then send the following information in email to <b>marfey</b>, which is at <i>gmail.com</i> (shhh...secrets!)</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Your nickname</b> (as it should appear in PROPS)</li>
  <li><b>Your favorite MOD</b> (or MODs, since they're all so awesome!)</li>
  <li><b>Who you donated to &amp; how much</b> (Doesn't matter how much - you will get <i>mad</i> PROPS as long as it's something!)</li>
  <li><b>How much Marfitude kicks ass!</b> (On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is "Totally awesome!" and 10 is "As cool as all the MODs in the world put together!")</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you donate, <i>you too</i> can be as cool as <b>all the MODs in the world</b> put together!</p>
