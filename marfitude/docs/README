This well-written document details everything you need to know about Marfitude. 
Or at least it used to - now I don't know what to put in here. There's a FAQ
online for some questions I assumed people might ask.

to fix slowness:
	make sure 3d is working (eg. in Windows make sure your driver supports
			OpenGL acceleration, otherwise it will be slow. In
			Linux make sure direct rendering is enabled, otherwise
			it will be slow.)
