Welcome to Marfitude!
Feel free to email me at marfey@gmail.com

This well-written document details everything you need to know about Marfitude. 
(Ok, just the options in your ~/.marfitude.cfg or init.cfg file for now.
That is all.)

Options:
main -
	song - the last song played
	volumethreshold - notes must be above this volume to be used (default 0)
	tracks - number of tracks to play (default 7)
video -
	width - screen width
	height - screen height
	bpp - bits per pixel - set to 32/24/16, or 0 for current
	fullscreen - yes makes it fullscreen (default no)
	lighting - would enable/disable lighting, if i let it :)
	textures - would enable/disable textures, if i let it :)
	particles - max # of particles (default 128)
sound -
	hz - frequency (default 44100)
	bits - 8 or 16
	buffersize - size of sound buffer: larger buffer = bigger delay
		smaller buffer = sound may click
		(default 512)
	channels - number of sound channels to use (default 32)
	interpolation - use interp. to make mods sound better (default yes)
joystick -
	joystickenable - set to 1 to enable joysticks (default 1)
	ignorejsXXbYY - set to 1 to ignore button YY on joystick XX
		- pad with 0 if less than 10
		- eg. to ignore button 12 on joystick 1 do ignorejs01b12=1

buttons -
	these should be set by using the configuration menu
	if they get screwed up somehow, i guess you could edit them by hand :)

to fix slowness:
	make sure 3d is working (eg. in Windows make sure your driver supports
			OpenGL acceleration, otherwise it will be slow)
	disable log (compile time option - CONFIG_LOG)
	disable memcheck (compile time option - CONFIG_MEMTEST)
